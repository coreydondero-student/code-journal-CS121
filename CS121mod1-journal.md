# Module 1 Notes
Notes for module 1 of CS121, Welcome to CS1. 

### Programs
A **program** is a series of instructions executed by a computer.

The instructions are called **statements**. Each statement ends in a **semicolon**.

### Variable
Variables hold varying values that are set by the user or another part of the program. A variable must be created before being assigned a value.

### Intput
Input commonly comes from a keyboard, file, web form or app. The following code enables a program to get input `import java.util.Scanner;`

A **Scanner** is a text parser that can get numbers, words or phrases from an input source. Use `Scanner scnr = new Scanner(System.in);` to get input from a keyboard.

### Output
`System.out.print` supports output. Output is achieved with `System.out.print("desired text")`. Text in the double quotes is called a **string literal**

`System.out.println("")` prints and starts a new line.

To output multiple items use `+`: `System.out.print("sometext" + variable);`
