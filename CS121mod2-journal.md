## 2.1 & 2.2 Variables and Assignments
**Variable**: Named item used to hold a value.  
**Assignment**: Assigns a variable with a value. The left side is a variable and the right side is an expression.  
**Example**: x = 1, y = 2, x = y *2, x = x * 2  
**Variable Declarations**: A statement that declares a new variable. Ex: `int userAge;` declares a new integer type variable called userAge. The compiler allocates a memory location for userAge capable of storing an integer.  
**Allocation** is the process of determining a suitable memory location to store data like variables.
