## 2.1 & 2.2 Variables and Assignments
**Variable**: Named item used to hold a value.  
**Assignment**: Assigns a variable with a value. The left side is a variable and the right side is an expression.  
**Example**: x = 1, y = 2, x = y *2, x = x * 2  
**Variable Declarations**: A statement that declares a new variable. Ex: `int userAge;` declares a new integer type variable called userAge. The compiler allocates a memory location for userAge capable of storing an integer.  
**Allocation**: is the process of determining a suitable memory location to store data like variables.  
**Assignment Statement**: assigns the variable on the left-side of the = with the current value of the right-side expression. Ex: `numApples = 8;` assigns numApples with the value 8.  
**Expression**: A number like 8 or a calculation like `1 + numApples`  
**Integer Literal**: A number that appears in an expression, like 8 or 1.  
**Initializing Variables**: Sometimes an initial value is assigned when declared. Ex: `int numCars = 5`
